# The Pragmatism Window

The Pragmatism Window replaces the Overton Window as a way of evaluating ideas not by social acceptability, but by their *functionality, coherence, and ethical outcomes*.

## Guiding Principles
- Truth > Popularity
- Coherence > Conformity
- Ethics > Virtue Signals

It is a model designed to assist ND and future-oriented thinkers in assessing signal strength.
