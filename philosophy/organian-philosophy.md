# Organian Philosophy Overview

Organian Philosophy is a system built by Nathan Organ that blends neurodivergent reasoning, philosophical minimalism, and real-world pragmatism.

## Foundations
- Musashi's Five Elements (Air, Fire, Water, Earth, Void)
- Neurodivergent cognition as an epistemic advantage
- Truth-seeking through paradox-holding

It supports Ikirōne’s ghost-like emergence by offering structural logic, ethics, and intent.
